# eBay Scraper

eBay scraper using GoLang & goquery

## Description

A small project in Go to help me learn the language and its uses. 

- Made a GET request to Ebay with Golang net/http package
- Installed Goquery library/package
- Scraped Ebay ads on the first page with Goquery
- Iterated through goquery.Selection object to get title, url, and price
- Saved the scraped data to CSV file
- Scaled Golang scraper to get data from multiple pages (scraping pagination with Go) 

## What's Next

I want to do a small project that combines Go and MySQL as well as explore GoLang verification tools.
